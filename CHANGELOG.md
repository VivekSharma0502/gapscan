## 2026-11-08: Phase 0 scaffold

**Added**
- Monorepo with `frontend/` (Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui) and `backend/` (FastAPI, SQLModel), so later phases have a working base.
- `GET /api/health` and a home page that calls it and shows the status, to prove the frontend and backend talk to each other end to end.
- `docker-compose.yml` with Redis published on loopback only, because it runs without auth locally.
- CORS allowlist read from the env, so only the configured frontend origins can call the API from a browser.
- pytest tests for the health route and CORS, plus ruff for backend lint.
- `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `README.md` and this changelog.
